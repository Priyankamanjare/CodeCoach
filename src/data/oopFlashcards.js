        question: "What is class & object?",
        answer: "Class → blueprint | Object → instance of class."

        question: "What is Encapsulation?",
        answer: "Wrapping data + methods; using private fields & getters."

    {
        question: "Abstraction?",
        answer: "Showing essential info → hiding implementation."

        question: "Inheritance?",
        answer: "Acquire properties from parent class → reuse code."

    {
        question: "Polymorphism?",
        answer: "Multiple forms → same function behaves differently."
    },

        question: "Interface?",
        answer: "Contract containing abstract methods → no implementation."
